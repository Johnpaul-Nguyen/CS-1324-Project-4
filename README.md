# CS-1324-Project-4
Goal: Taking user inputs and incrementing a counter for each "yes" input the user has. Each input should ignore cases and work with any orientation of "yes", i.e., "yes", "Yes", "YeS", "YEs", etc.

The incentive for this project is to determine whether the user is tired or stressed using questions and based on their response, provide them an appropriate answer.
